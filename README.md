# Computer_Vision_Classification - VGG-19, ResNet, and MobileNet

Dataset contains images of the following food items: noise-Indian market and images of vegetables- onion, potato and tomato. The images in this dataset were scraped from Google.The objective is to develop a program that can recognize the vegetable item(s) in a photo and identify them for the user.
